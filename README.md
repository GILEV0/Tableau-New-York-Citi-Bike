Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicise and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Instructions
Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

1. Design 2–5 visualisations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple      datasets from different periods.

The following are questions you may wish to answer. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative!

  - How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
    
  - By what percentage has total ridership grown?
  - What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
  - What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
  - Top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
  - Top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
  - Bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?
  - Bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 
 
2. Use your visualisations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.

3. Create one of the following visualisations for city officials:

    - Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
    - Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
    - The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

4. Create your final presentation:

    - Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualisations, requested maps, and dashboards.
    - Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.

I use Tableau Desktop to present the data results and the link to the dashboard is available here: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/victoria.giles/viz/NewYorkCitiBikeAnalysis_16758471146030/Story1?publish=yes)
